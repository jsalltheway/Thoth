/* policies file */


/* 
The format of this policy file is

exports.resource = ThothPolicyModel.create({
   action: function(storeRequest,user,record,callback){
   
   }
})

where resource is the name of your database table or bucket
and action is either 'create','update','refresh', 'destroy' or 'filter'
the ONR fetch action will use the refresh action

The return value of every function can be:
- YES:      Access of this action type to the record or resource is allowed
- NO:       Access of this action type to the record or resource is not allowed
- "retry":  Access of this action type to the record or resource can not be 
            determined at this moment because of lack of record data. The system is asked this way to retry later when more data is available.
            (this case is purely available for the refresh action)
- a record: Access of this action type to the record is allowed, and needs to use the record returned as it has modifications

These functions are NOT called if the users role is one of the predefined roles in either the myPolicies file or
in the created ThothPolicies object. The policy module will check this before calling these functions.
